C# Projects

These are projects I made using C# and .NET.

Projects:
•	Twenty One
•	Car Insurance
•	Newsletter

Twenty One
This version of the classic game also known as Black Jack, allows the players play against the dealer in a console app. The program uses a randomizer to shuffle and deal the cards. There is also a fraud exception to prevent the player from betting negative numbers. 
Car Insurance
For this project using Entity Framework a web app is made for determining eligability and pricing for car insurance. Limits are put on for age, age of car, type of car, and any DUIs. There is an admin page that the company can use to see pricing, that the customer facing page doesn't allow.

Newsletter
This simple web app is for creating a newsletter subscription list. Using SQL as a database first and attching it to the solution. A user can submit their own information to be on the list. Also created an Admin view so subsribers can be removed.
There are several other smaller projects that highlight different featers, such as enums, structs, BooleanLoops, Lambda, and polymorphism.
